    This is a useless one but first of all look at santas crotch it looks like I'm censoring his bits but,
     the background of the page was supposed to be that beige color so it would've blended in 
     BUT changing the background color wasn't working as animation and without animation it looked wrong so I left it.
     If you want to see how it was meant to look like click on santa after you finish reading the rest
     (ignore the head and the gift that aren't going to the background)<br>
     Second of all, 
     I want to be your santa every year. I know I'll never be as good at gift-giving as you since you always find the perfect, crazy, dumb present for me, something that shows you really know me and care about me.
     I promise to keep trying though, and I hope that one day I'll be able to match your talent. But even if I never do, I'll always love giving you gifts. <br>You're the best gift I could ever ask for.
