        <h1>My love,</h1>
    </hgroup>
    <p>
      Christmas is overrated, magical time and whatever, nevertheless my heart aches knowing that we are not together on this "special night". To be fair my heart aches every time we're not together.
      I wrote this letter hoping my words can bring you some comfort and break the distance a little, also to express my deep love for you.<br>
      I want you to know that you mean so fucking much to me without even a shadow of doubt. Past few days have not been bright and things were down and proper shit but even at the darkest time,
      my feelings for you were as strong and there was no doubt at any single moment. Despite the shit we are facing, I still hold on and believe that our love is stronger than all of it. 
      I know these are empty words but I really do believe we can be amazing because we are, and I know we need to deal with it and not ignore it but we will and we can, I wrote this on a very shit day
       but even on this day I have no doubt and I still believe in us.<br>
       I miss you so much, I miss you terribly, not having you by my side leaves a hole in my chest, it actually hurts every moment seems dull and insignificant. Life is just incomplete without you, 
       it's like I'm simply trying to hold on and survive until that day, I'm not living.<br>
       I just want to say that despite the distance and every other factor, my belief is unshaken, I know we can overcome everything and come out the other side stronger than ever 
       I know we can be on the same team and not let anything between us. <br>
       You are the light in my life that literally brightens my days and gives me reason, I wish I could look into your eyes, I wish I could hold you tight, I just want to tell you how much you mean to me.<br>
       I love you<br>
       I hope things are going okay with you, this is your sign to send me a message updating me.<br>
       Just know no matter where I am or what I'm doing, I'm thinking of you and wishing I was with you.<br>
       <br>
       Merry Christmas soulmate.
       <br><br>
